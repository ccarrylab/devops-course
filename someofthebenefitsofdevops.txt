The benefits of DevOps
Companies that incorporate DevOps practices get more done, plain and simple. With a single team composed of cross-functional members all working in collaboration, DevOps organizations can deliver with maximum speed, functionality, and innovation.

There are technical benefits:

Continuous software delivery
Less complexity to manage
Faster resolution of problems

There are cultural benefits:

Happier, more productive teams
Higher employee engagement
Greater professional development opportunities

And there are business benefits:

Faster delivery of features
More stable operating environments
Improved communication and collaboration
More time to innovate (rather than fix/maintain)
